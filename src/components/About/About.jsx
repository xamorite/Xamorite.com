         < p className=" my-[3vw] text-base">
         I hold a Bachelors degree in Graphic Design and have been working in the design industry for over a decade. During this time, I have honed my skills in design principles, user experience, and front-end development. Im proficient in design tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, Adobe Xd and Figma, and have a deep understanding of front-end development languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript & different types of frameworks.
         </p>
         
         <p className=" my-[3vw] text-base">
          My passion for development & design started when I was young, and I have pursued this passion by working with a variety of clients and projects over the years. I have worked with startups, small businesses, and large corporations, creating user interfaces & front-end development for websites, software applications, and mobile apps.</p>

         <p className=" my-[3vw] text-base">
          As a Senior Developer & UI Designer, my focus is on creating engaging and intuitive user interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience. I believe that design should be user-centric, and my approach to design reflects this belief. I work closely with my clients to understand their users needs, conduct user research, and create wireframes and prototypes to ensure that the final design meets both user and business goals and also focus on developing.</p>

          <p className="my-[3vw] text-base">
          In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new design trends and technologies, attending design conferences and workshops, and sharing my knowledge with the design community. And also trying to learn more frameworks and libraries of javascripts like react.js, next.js, three.js or GSAP etc. Im always excited to collaborate on new projects and would love to hear from you. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions or if youd like to work together.
